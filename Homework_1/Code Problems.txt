 1 - Use Intention-Revealing names 
 For example, in the print() method we don't know who is "vb" and it 
 doesn't have any role since the method only prints a message, so we'll get rid of it.
 In the calculate() method we have the same case, we don't know and have no use for the "temp"
 variable, so we'll delete it.
 2 - Pick one word per concept
 If we consider that the variables named with an underscore are two-word, then we can rename them using
 the camelCase system. The naming convention with an underscore is wrong, or at least in my opinion.
